            "text": "Purdue University is committed to fostering a community where scholarship, research and creative expression thrive. Academic freedom is fundamental to the pursuit of knowledge because it encourages open discourse, inquiry and debate among faculty and students. Distinct from academic freedom, the University recognizes and upholds the rights and protections guaranteed under the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, as more fully embodied in its Commitment to Freedom of Expression. Faculty, lecturers, instructors, researchers and students have full freedom as researchers, scholars and artists, and are assured freedom to communicate their work, to advocate solutions to human problems and to criticize existing institutions. This freedom is subject only to adequate performance of their academic duties and to obligations they may have voluntarily assumed in accepting support for their scholarly work or research. It should be recognized that research activities are also subject to state and federal laws and regulations and to University policies and procedures, including but not limited to Intellectual Property (I.A.1), Export Controls and OFAC Regulations (I.A.2), Research Misconduct (III.A.2) and those designed to protect the rights and welfare of human subjects. Faculty, lecturers and instructors have freedom in the classroom in discussing their subject matter. They also have the responsibility to avoid infringing upon their students' right to learn by introducing irrelevant subject matter. Tenured faculty members are members of society; when they speak or write in that capacity, freedom from University discipline prevails. The special position in the community enjoyed by a tenured faculty member, however, imposes special obligations. As a scholar and a member of the University faculty, the public may judge one's profession and the University by public utterances. A faculty member is expected to make every effort to indicate that they are not a spokesperson for the University when speaking or acting as a private person. A faculty member who assumes a governmental or political position or responsibility with the full consent and knowledge of the University is protected in their tenure rights in the event of controversy arising from the performance of such governmental or political duties."
